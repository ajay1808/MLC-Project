Weather anomalies imply a feeling of uncertainty among commuters. The weather
change has revealed behavioral shifts in relation to a person's decision to utilize numerous or
single modes of transportation during his commute. Weather can have a significant impact on
transportation in New York City, as it can affect road and sidewalk conditions, as well as the
operation of public transportation systems. For example, heavy snowfall can make roads and
sidewalks slippery and difficult to navigate, leading to traffic delays and disruptions to public
transportation services. Similarly, extreme heat can cause train tracks to expand and contract,
leading to slower train speeds and potential delays. Additionally, severe weather events such
as hurricanes and tropical storms can cause widespread power outages and flooding, which can
severely disrupt transportation systems. Overall, weather can have both positive and negative
effects on transportation in New York City, depending on the specific weather conditions and
the transportation mode being used. The study will forecast the movement between various
public modes of transport of individuals throughout their everyday commutes over the course
of different weather seasons. The project involves collecting data on the weather patterns in
New York City and the transportation choices of its residents. This data could then be used to
develop a model that predicts how the weather may influence a person's transportation
preference. The model could be used to help city planners and transportation providers better
understand and plan for the transportation needs of New Yorkers based on the weather.
